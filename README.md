# Baby Calendar

Working on baby-calendar.net.pl ... work in progress, one

Basic website for managing various data of your newly born child.

## About

Baby calendar is written in JavaScript with usage of React.js and Redux (client side) and Node.js with usage of
Express.js and MongoDB (server side). App uses free basic plan of MongoDB hosting from mLab, so there might be downtimes
where application won't work or database connection won't work. If you can't enter app website, please try again later.
Please note that it is currently at very early development stage, so please expect bugs, crashes and rudimentary visual side of app.
Most likely it won't be further worked on.

## Features

Right now in application you store data about child's name and birthdate (app will automatically calculate child age
in weeks). You can also store child's weight, diaper, inoculation, infections and various notes entries.
